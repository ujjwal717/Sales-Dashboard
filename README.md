# Sales-Dashboard

**Situation**

Many start-ups and companies in general find it difficult to manage their sales and relevant KPIs that can track their performance in various regions, states, and more. They are also not able to understand the regions, products, or services that they need to push more or improve because of the same reason.

**Task**

To address this issue for the company, I decided to develop a Sales Dashboard. Being the principal data analyst, my mission was to develop a comprehensive and understandable dashboard that conveys actionable insights and relevant KPIs to track and monitor performance.

**Action**

I used Excel to create the dashboard. To create the dashboard, I got the data and cleaned and transformed it using Excel. I designed the dashboard to include key metrics such as Total Sales, Total Profit, Total Cost, Total Quantity Sold, Average Delivery Days, and Order Count. The dashboard also includes Slicers for Order Date, State, and Region. It also includes actionable and informative visuals such as Top Cities by Maximum Profit, Top Products by Quantity Sold, Sales across Date, and Profit distribution across Sales Channel.

**Result**

The dashboard has been a tremendous success, providing valuable and actionable insights in monitoring sales as well as focusing on cities, states, and regions for potential improvements. The company especially liked some additional KPIs and visuals of the dashboard such as “Average Delivery Days“, “Quantity Sold“, “Top Cities by Profit“, and “Top Products by Quantity Sold” which allowed them to understand sales as well as to improve their service and marketing strategies.

**Some Quantifiable results include:**

    Enhanced Profit Margin by 10-15% through optimizing sales channels.
    Improved Inventory Optimization by 20-25% based on Top Performing Products.
    Reduced Delivery Times by 10-15% by focusing on average delivery time across different cities, states, and regions.
    Improved ROI and Regional Marketing by 25-30% by Targeting Top Cities with Maximum Profit.
    Reduced Cost Efficiency by 5-10% through crucial KPIs developed such as Total Cost, Total Profit, and Total Sales.
    Improved Sales Forecasting by 15-20% through sales trends and seasonal peaks to reduce excess inventory and staffing costs.
